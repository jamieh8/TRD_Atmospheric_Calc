Code used to perform detailed balance calculations for estimating potential power output from terrestrial thermoradiative diodes, using radiative transfer modelling results.

Folders "simulations_23dec" and "simulations_24oct" contain the results from the LBLRTM modelling for the 9 conditions sampled.

Important classes and functions are defined in the TRD_Atmospheric_Functions.py file.
Code used to create figures for the paper is stored in the "plotting for paper" folder. Other files were used for testing or for generating the results plotted.
