Eventually, here is a set of simulations generated for realistic atmospheric cases over Telfer, Australia.  Fei identified this as a site that had relatively clear conditions (generally), but also experienced a large range of atmospheric water vapour concentrations, expressed here as total column water vapour (TCWV, the total amount of water vapour in the vertical column of atmosphere above the site).  For these simulations there were 10, 24 and 54 mm of column water vapour (as per file name).  10 mm is relatively low, 54 mm is high (see Total column water vapour Map - Bing images for an example).

Each file contains seven floating point arrays of 4000 points, arranged as (7,4000) – if that makes sense to you.  I’ve converted them to text format so you should be able to just open and view the numbers.

The arrays are ordered as:
Wavenumber in cm-1 from 500-2500 in steps of 0.5 cm-1 (wavenumber provided is centre point of bin)
Downwelling radiance at surface at zenith (i.e. looking straight up) for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1 sr-1 (watts per sq cm per wavenumber per steradian)
Downwelling radiance at surface at 53 degrees from zenith for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1 sr-1
Downwelling radiance at surface at 70 degrees from zenith for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1 sr-1
*Downwelling flux at surface for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1 (watts per sq cm per wavenumber)
**Upwelling flux at surface for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1
***Net flux up from surface for each wavenumber bin, in W cm-2 (cm-1)-1

*Downwelling flux calculated using a simple diffusivity approximation (pi x 53 degree angle radiance (column 4).  This is ok as a first approx.
**Upwelling flux calculated using Planck function x pi.  Assumes isotopic emitter.
***Net flux is difference of * and **.  Some very small negative numbers have been set to zero (consequence of approximations).  These occur in regions where the transmittance is tending to zero so not useful for your application.

To help, below is a plot of the net upwelling flux for each case (note change in flux unit).   White is 10 mm TCWV, yellow 24 mm and red 54 mm.  Broadly speaking, the larger the amount of water vapour, the smaller the net flux because of enhanced downward emission.  However, there are spectral regions where this is not true, likely because the structure of the temperature and water vapour profiles with height also plays a role and these are different for the different times.

We have examples from a couple of other locations too if helpful.  And it is fairly straightforward to generate similar outputs for clear-sky conditions for anywhere on the globe.
